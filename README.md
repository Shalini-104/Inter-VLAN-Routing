# Inter-VLAN-Routing
# Inter-VLAN routing means connecting different VLANs so that devices in one VLAN can talk to the devices in another VLAN
# Here I have implemented Router on stick (ROS) configuration to create an inter-vlan network where we have totally different vlan networks communicating with each other 
# For checking the connectivity between the devices ping any device from another one
# For Example: click on Laptop1 (having an IP as 10.0.0.3) -> then click on Desktop -> there will be a command prompt just open it and write: ping 30.0.0.4 --> This command will show you whether the two devices have connectivity or not
